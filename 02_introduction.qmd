## Context 

The importance of health regions in the planning of Brazilâ€™s Unified Health System (SUS).

## Current challenges

- heterogeneous criteria
- politically driven definition
- limited use of robust statistical methods

## Research problem 

How can we propose a data-driven health regionalization method that accounts for uncertainty and temporal dynamics?

## Objectives

- Apply the Bayesian space-time partitioning model to propose and evaluate health regionalizations in Brazil.
- Explore health data sources (hospitalizations, health infrastructure, mortality, primary care coverage).
- Define probabilistic health regions based on these data.
- Compare estimated regions with official health regions and with the REGIC (IBGE).
- Discuss implications for health policy and planning.
