    "text": "K-means Implementation\nThe k-means algorithm will be applied to partition Brazilian municipalities into clusters based on health-related indicators. This serves as a baseline method for regionalization, providing a simple, well-known clustering approach against which more sophisticated models (e.g., Bayesian space-time partitioning) can be evaluated.\n\n1. Mathematical Definition\nGiven a set of \\(n\\) observations \\(\\mathbf{X} = \\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\}\\), where each \\(x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\) is a $d $-dimensional feature vector representing health data for a municipality, the k-means algorithm partitions the data into \\(k\\) disjoint clusters \\(C = \\{C_1, C_2, \\ldots,\nC_k\\}\\) such that the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) is minimized:\n\\[\n\\underset{C}{\\arg\\min} \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\sum_{x_i \\in C_j} \\|x_i - \\mu_j\\|^2\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(\\mu_j\\) is the centroid (mean) of cluster \\(C_j\\), computed as: \\[\n\\mu_j = \\frac{1}{|C_j|} \\sum_{x_i \\in C_j} x_i\n\\]\n\\(\\|\\cdot\\|\\) denotes the Euclidean norm.\n\nThe objective is to find a partition where municipalities within the same cluster are as similar as possible, based on their health profiles.\n\n\n2. Number of Clusters (\\(k\\))\nChoosing the appropriate number of clusters \\(k\\) is crucial. While it can be informed by domain knowledge (e.g., number of official health regions), we will also use two data-driven methods:\n\nElbow Method:\nPlot the total WCSS as a function of \\(k\\) and look for the “elbow” point where the rate of decrease sharply changes.\nSilhouette Score:\nFor each point, the silhouette score compares the average distance to other points in the same cluster with the average distance to points in the nearest neighboring cluster. The optimal \\(k\\) maximizes the average silhouette score across all points.\n\n\n\n3. Initialization of Centroids\n\nRandom Initialization:\nSelect \\(k\\) random observations as initial centroids. This can lead to poor or inconsistent results depending on the starting points.\nK-means++:\nImproves initialization by choosing the first centroid randomly and the remaining ones probabilistically based on their distance from already selected centroids. This method helps avoid poor clustering outcomes and accelerates convergence.\n\n\n\n4. Algorithm Steps\nThe k-means algorithm follows an iterative procedure:\n\nInitialization: Choose initial centroids \\(\\mu_1, \\ldots, \\mu_k\\).\nAssignment Step: Assign each point \\(x_i\\) to the nearest centroid:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Assign } x_i \\text{ to } C_j \\text{ where } j = \\arg\\min_{l \\in \\{1,\n\\ldots, k\\}} \\|x_i - \\mu_l\\|^2\n\\]\n\nUpdate Step: Recalculate each centroid: \\[\n\\mu_j = \\frac{1}{|C_j|} \\sum_{x_i \\in C_j} x_i\n\\]\nConvergence Check: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until:\n\nCluster assignments do not change; or\nA maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\n\n\n\n5. Distance Metric\nWe will use the Euclidean distance as the default metric for similarity:\n\\[\nd(x_i, x_j) = \\|x_i - x_j\\|_2 = \\sqrt{\\sum_{l=1}^{d} (x_{il} - x_{jl})^2}\n\\]\nSince health indicators may be on different scales (e.g., hospital beds vs. mortality rates), features will be standardized before clustering to ensure comparability.\n\n\n6. Post-Processing and Evaluation\nAfter clustering:\n\nWe will map the clusters spatially to examine whether the partitions correspond to geographic or administrative patterns.\nThe results will be compared with:\n\nOfficial health regions (e.g., IBGE-defined or Ministry of Health regions),\nREGIC 2018 functional regions.\n\n\nEvaluation metrics will include:\n\nClustering agreement:\n\nRand Index\nJaccard Index\nF1-Score\n\nHealth indicator error measures:\n\nMean Absolute Error (MAE)\nMean Squared Error (MSE)\n\n\nThese comparisons will help assess the degree to which k-means can approximate existing regional structures and whether it captures relevant patterns in the health data.",
